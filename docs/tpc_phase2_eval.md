# TPC 2026 Phase 2 Evaluation

This document defines how we **measure and iterate** on the Phase 2 harness described in
`docs/tpc_phase2_design.md`. It is the methodology reference; the scripts that implement it are listed
per metric.

## Guiding Idea

We hold the released oracle (`hard_logic_py`) **locally** for the 1000 Phase-1 queries. Phase 2 hides
it from the agent, but we can still use it as **ground truth** to score a no-oracle run and to attribute
failures. This gives a held-out-style signal without an actual held-out set.

Two anchors bound every measurement:

- **Ceiling:** oracle `results/best` (near-optimal, but reached with unlimited iteration and some
  manually/LLM-solved plans — an aspiration, not an in-harness baseline).
- **Floor:** the generic `opencode`/`codex` baseline harness (prompt-only agent).

Our no-oracle system should climb from the floor toward the ceiling; the remaining gap to the ceiling is
our parsing + orchestration loss.

## Three Measurement Axes

### Axis 1 — Parsing quality (parsed constraints vs oracle)

Goal: how faithfully does Stage 1 recover the true constraints from natural language? Two complementary
methods, both reusing existing code:

1. **Structural diff in a shared schema.** Oracle mode already normalizes `hard_logic_py` into the
   solver dict via `solver_constraint_variants(use_oracle=True)`. Run the no-oracle parser into the
   *same* schema and diff field-by-field. Report **precision / recall / value-accuracy per constraint
   family**, with buckets:
   - `missing` — a real constraint was not extracted (recall miss),
   - `spurious` — a constraint was invented (precision miss / hallucination),
   - `wrong_value` — extracted but with the wrong value,
   - `disjunction_flattened` — an OR-group was collapsed into a single flat variant.
2. **Behavioral equivalence.** Use the parsed constraints and the oracle constraints each as a verifier
   over a plan set (the oracle-optimal `results/best` plan plus a few perturbations) and check they
   accept/reject **identically**. Catches semantic errors the structural diff misses.

Script: `scripts/parser_vs_oracle.py` → per-query and aggregate report (CSV + JSON).

### Axis 2 — Solver quality, decoupled from parsing

Goal: given the *correct* constraints, does the solver consistently produce valid plans **inside the
harness budget, autonomously**? Feed the **oracle** constraints to the solver (parsing out of the
picture) but run in **cold / bounded / autonomous** mode: single run, Phase-2 per-query budget, no
manual help, no multi-day iteration.

This is deliberately distinct from `results/best`, which used tools we will not have at inference time.

Attribution decomposition (computed across the full batch/folds):

```
results/best (oracle, unlimited + manual help)        = aspirational ceiling
   gap = solver headroom lost to the time budget
solver-only (oracle constraints, bounded, autonomous) = achievable in-harness solver ceiling
   gap = parsing loss
end-to-end (no-oracle, bounded, autonomous)           = what Phase 2 actually scores
```

Reading the gaps:

- **end-to-end far below solver-only** → invest in the parser (Axis 1).
- **solver-only far below results/best** → the solver is not robust/fast enough on its own; work on the
  solver independent of parsing.

"Must consistently solve **all** queries" becomes concrete: **solver-only FPR should approach 100%**
before parser work is even in scope. Always aggregate across the full batch/folds, but keep per-query
rows so we can rebuild a tail-focus queue like Phase 1 (`scripts/rank_tail.py`).

Script: `scripts/rehearse_phase2.py` with two modes (`--mode end-to-end`, `--mode solver-only`) sharing
one core, both cold/bounded/autonomous at the Phase-2 budget.

### Axis 3 — Harness / pipeline reliability

Goal: does the harness reliably return a valid answer on time, run after run?

Metrics:

- **valid-output rate** — fraction of queries returning a schema-valid plan (never a parse-failure zero
  when avoidable),
- **timeout rate** and **crash rate**,
- **per-stage timing** p50/p95 (parse / solve / improve / finalize) vs the budget split,
- **run-to-run score variance** across N repeats. The organizers run each harness **5× and average**,
  and the LLM (when enabled) introduces nondeterminism, so variance is a first-class metric.

Script: `scripts/phase2_timing.py` (timing + variance), fed by per-stage telemetry the orchestrator
emits.

## Rehearsal Folds vs Full Regression Set

- **Rehearsal folds:** rotating subsets of `tpc_phase1` used during iteration, so we do not overfit the
  parser to queries we hand-tuned on. Fold selection is deterministic (seeded) and recorded.
- **Full regression set:** all 1000 `tpc_phase1` queries, scored less frequently as the final check.
- **Generalization set (candidate):** the Hugging Face `LAMDA-NeSy/ChinaTravel` dataset, if it contains
  queries/phrasings beyond the released split (see `docs/tpc_phase2_hf_dataset.md` and Task 12). Held-out
  phrasing is the exact Phase-2 risk, so an independent generalization set is valuable.

## Baselines To Track

| Baseline | How | Role |
| -------- | --- | ---- |
| `results/best` (oracle) | existing Phase-1 best | ceiling |
| solver-only (oracle, bounded) | `rehearse_phase2.py --mode solver-only` | achievable solver ceiling |
| end-to-end (no-oracle, bounded) | `rehearse_phase2.py --mode end-to-end` | what Phase 2 scores |
| `opencode`/`codex` baseline | `agent_env/scripts/solve_script_with_harness.py` | floor |

## Iteration Dashboard And Regression Gate

- **Dashboard:** `make phase2-rehearse` chains rehearse → official score → parsing report → timing/variance
  into one report over the current fold, printing the three-way attribution and the axis metrics.
- **Regression gate:** reuse the monotonic philosophy of `scripts/merge.py`. A change is only promoted if,
  on the rehearsal fold, it does **not**:
  - drop official score,
  - increase parse-failure count,
  - increase timeout/crash count.

  The gate makes the "flags off ⇒ deterministic path unchanged" rule enforceable and lets us add each
  improvement (disjunction expansion, LLM parse, LLM refine) and immediately see its measured effect.

## Metric → Command Map

| Metric | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| End-to-end official score (no-oracle, bounded) | `python scripts/rehearse_phase2.py --mode end-to-end --split <fold>` |
| Solver-only official score (oracle, bounded) | `python scripts/rehearse_phase2.py --mode solver-only --split <fold>` |
| Three-way attribution | either rehearse mode prints ceiling/solver/end-to-end lines |
| Parsing precision/recall + buckets | `python scripts/parser_vs_oracle.py --split <fold>` |
| Behavioral equivalence | `python scripts/parser_vs_oracle.py --split <fold> --behavioral` |
| Per-stage timing p50/p95 | `python scripts/phase2_timing.py --split <fold>` |
| Run-to-run variance | `python scripts/phase2_timing.py --split <fold> --repeats N` |
| Full dashboard + gate | `make phase2-rehearse FOLD=<fold>` |

(Commands reflect the planned interfaces in `docs/tpc_phase2_implementation_plan.md`; scripts are built
in the implementation phase.)
